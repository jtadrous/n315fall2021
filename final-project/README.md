An e-commerce site modeled off of Keurig.com

Description: This an e-commerce website that sells Keuring brand coffee makers. It's purpose is to allow customers to easily shop for the top coffee makers. Users can sign up easily with their first name, last name, email, and password. They can also login and logout easily based on user feedback. Once a user is logged in, they are able to add multiple items to their cart, remove items from their cart, and checkout. While logged out, they are only able to browse the coffee maker inventory. I created this application to practice my web development skills and use various tools such as firebase.
